## Code from my research, which investigated the relationship between car accidents and traffic congestion

This is part of my research at Tel-Aviv University. I studied the effect of traffic congestions over accidents. 
I found significant and negative relation, which I clame is casual.

# the code is in R languages
# for this project you will need the following packages:
- data.table
- tidyverse
- dplyr
- magrittr
- qwraps2
- car
- AER
- ggplot2
- gridExtra
